# Chess

The timeless strategy of chess meets the exciting world of crypto betting. Test your skills against opponents in fast-paced matches, all under the security of blockchain technology. Here’s what you need to know:

## Game Setup

1. **Board and Pieces:** Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns, placed on an 8x8 grid following standard chess rules.
2. **Piece Colors:** One player plays with the white pieces, and the other plays with the black pieces. The player with the white pieces makes the first move.
3. **Objective:** The ultimate aim is to checkmate your opponent’s king, meaning the king is under attack and there is no legal move to escape capture.

## Game Play

1. **Turns:** Players alternate moves, with each player having one minute to complete their move. If a player does not move within this time, they automatically lose the game.
2. **Check and Checkmate:** If a king is in check, the player must make a move to remove the check. Checkmate occurs when the king is in check and cannot escape; this results in a win for the attacking player.
3. **Draws:** The game can end in a draw under several conditions, such as stalemate, insufficient material, threefold repetition, or the fifty-move rule.

## Betting and Payouts

- **Smart Contract Transactions:** All bets and payouts are handled through a transparent and secure smart contract.
- **Stake:** Each player contributes an equal amount of cryptocurrency (100%) to initiate the game.
- **Platform Rake:** Arcadia Games applies a 10% rake to the total pot for the provision of the platform and its services.
- **Winner’s Reward:** The winner receives 180% of the initial stake from the total pot after the rake deduction. If the game ends in a draw, the remaining pot after rake deduction is equally divided between the two players.

## Fair Play and Conduct

1. **Timely Moves:** Players are required to make each move within a 60-second window to ensure a dynamic and continuous game flow.
2. **Sportsmanship:** Respectful and courteous behavior is expected from all players, promoting a positive gaming environment.
3. **No Cheating:** Automated decision-making software, consulting third-party sources, or any form of cheating is strictly prohibited.
