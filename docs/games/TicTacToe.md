# Tic-Tac-Toe

The classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe meets cutting-edge blockchain technology. Engage in head-to-head battles, stake your crypto, and decide how many rounds you want to challenge your opponent. Here’s your guide to the game:

## Game Setup

1. **Board Layout:** The Tic-Tac-Toe board consists of a 3x3 grid, totaling nine squares.
2. **Symbols:** One player uses ‘X’ and the other uses ‘O’. Players decide who uses which symbol before the game starts.
3. **Rounds:** Players can choose the number of rounds they wish to play in a match. Each round is a separate game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Game Play

1. **Taking Turns:** Players take turns placing their symbol (‘X’ or ‘O’) in one of the nine squares.
2. **Objective:** The aim is to be the first to get three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
3. **Round Winner:** A player wins a round by placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
4. **Draws:** If all nine squares are filled without either player achieving three in a row, the round is considered a draw.
5. **Match Winner:** The player who wins the most rounds out of the predetermined set becomes the match winner.

## Betting and Payouts

- **Smart Contract Transactions:** All bets and payouts are processed through a secure, transparent smart contract.
- **Stake:** Before the match starts, each player contributes an equal crypto stake to the game’s total pot.
- **Rake:** Arcadia Games collects a 10% rake from the total pot for hosting the game and providing services.
- **Round Payouts:** After each round, no immediate payouts are made. The total stakes continue to accumulate.
- **Final Payout:** After all rounds have been completed, the player with the most round victories receives 180% of the total initial stakes, after the rake has been deducted. In case of an overall draw (equal number of round wins), the total pot after rake deduction is split equally between the players.

## Fair Play and Conduct

1. **Time Limits:** Players have 60 seconds to make each move. Failing to make a move within this time frame results in forfeiting the round.
2. **Sportsmanship:** Players are expected to maintain respectful and fair play throughout the game.
3. **No Cheating:** The use of external tools or methods to influence the game’s outcome is strictly prohibited.
