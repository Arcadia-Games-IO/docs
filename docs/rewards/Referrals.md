### Referrals: Amplify Your Earnings with Friends!

Boost your Points effortlessly by introducing your friends to Arcadia Games!

Secure a sweet 20% of the rakes garnered by your referrals, and bag an additional 5% from the Points earned by any friends they invite. Strategy for the shrewd: bring in the big players to swiftly climb the leaderboards.

Referral benefits are applicable during both the BOOST phase and the standard seasons.

⚙️ **Understanding the Mechanics**
Referral bonds are formed the moment a referred friend completes any of these actions within 30 days of applying your referral code:

- Engaging in any game on Arcadia Games
- Linking their Twitter or Discord account

Upon someone clicking your referral link or using your code, they become exclusively linked to you for 30 days, shielding them from being referred by others. Post this period, the field is open again for referrals.

👥 **Referral Points Allocation**
Referral Points are promptly credited to your account, recorded as an off-chain transaction for immediate use.

💯 **Tracking Your Referral Points**
Your referral Points tally is visible on the Points summary page, accessible via the Rewards section.
