### Rakebacks and Rewards Overview

At Arcadia Games, we apply a minimal fee structure: 10% on the ARCADIA stake between you and your opponent. These fees are partially funneled back to our community in three distinct areas.

🧑‍🌾 **User Rakebacks (variable percentage)**
⚠️ Heads up: User Rakebacks are coming soon and will be applied retroactively... ⚠️

Rakebacks offer a way for users to recover a portion of their fees over time. Presently, we're returning around 20% of collected fees back to our users.

Here's a simple breakdown: Arcadia Games divides the day into two 12-hour segments. If Alice spends 1 ETH on fees one morning, she's entitled to receive back 0.3 ETH across the next four periods.

For example, if she incurs these fees during Phase 0 (00:00 – 12:00 UTC):
- She can claim 0.075 ETH during Phase 1 starting at 12:00 UTC.
- At the onset of Phase 2 (00:00 UTC the next day), another 0.075 ETH is claimable.
- By Phase 3 at 12:00 UTC, she gets an additional 0.075 ETH.
- And by Phase 4 at 00:00 UTC the day following, she claims her final 0.075 ETH.

If Alice continues playing, her new rakeback will be added to her upcoming payouts.

⚠️ Act Fast!
Rakeback rewards must be claimed quickly, as they expire at the end of each phase. Unclaimed rakebacks from one phase forfeit after the next, transferring to the Treasury instead.

🪄 **Lotteries (15%)**
We reserve 10% of daily and 5% of weekly fees for our exciting Daily and Weekly Lotteries.

🏦 **Future Incentives (35%)**
We allocate the remaining 35% of fees towards upcoming promotions, new initiatives, and innovative ways to give back to our community.
