# Battleships

Welcome to **Arcadia Games**, your destination for retro PvP gaming with a crypto twist. Engage in Battleships, where strategy meets fortune in a blockchain-secured environment. Here’s everything you need to know:

## Game Setup

1. **Board Configuration:** Each player receives a 10x10 grid to strategically place their fleet.
2. **Fleet Composition:**
   - 1x Battleship (occupies 5 squares)
   - 2x Cruisers (each occupies 4 squares)
   - 3x Destroyers (each occupies 3 squares)
   - 4x Submarines (each occupies 2 squares)
   Ships must be oriented either horizontally or vertically and cannot overlap or directly touch each other.
3. **Placement Rules:** Ships cannot be positioned diagonally and must be separated by at least one square from any other ship.

## Game Play

1. **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns, aiming to hit their opponent's ships by specifying grid coordinates (e.g., "A5").
2. **Outcome Reporting:** The Node-based game system automatically reports "hits" or "misses" to both players, eliminating the possibility of cheating.
3. **Sinking and Reporting:** The system will notify both players when a ship is sunk.
4. **Time Limit:** Each player has one minute to take their turn. Failing to act within this timeframe results in an automatic loss.
5. **Victory Conditions:** The game concludes when all of a player's ships are sunk. The remaining player with unsunk ships is declared the winner.

## Betting and Payouts

- **Smart Contract Transactions:** All game stakes and payouts are managed through a blockchain smart contract for transparency and security.
- **Stake Requirement:** Players each contribute an identical crypto stake (100%) to the game's pot.
- **Platform Rake:** A 5% rake is taken from the total pot for platform services and game hosting.
- **Winner’s Payout:** The victor receives 190% of the initial pot after the platform's rake. This system ensures a lucrative reward for the winner while maintaining fair play.

## Fair Play and Conduct

1. **Automated Integrity:** The Node-based game structure ensures fair play by automating turn responses and ship tracking.
2. **Time Management:** Players must make their moves within the allocated one-minute window to maintain game flow and fairness.
3. **Respectful Interaction:** Players should maintain respectful communication and sportsmanship throughout the game.

Prepare your strategy, place your fleet, and may the most cunning admiral win at Arcadia Games!
